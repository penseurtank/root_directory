brew update
brew install nvm
mkdir ~/.nvm
nano ~/.bash_profile
""***
You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:

mkdir ~/.nvm

Add the following to ~/.bash_profile or your desired shell
configuration file:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && . "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && . "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" # This loads nvm bash_completion

You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
/usr/local/opt/nvm will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
upon upgrade/reinstall.

Type `nvm help` for further information.
""***

In your .bash_profile file (you may be using an other file, according to your shell), add the following :

export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

Back to your shell, activate nvm and check it (if you have other shells opened and you want to keep them, do the same) :

source ~/.bash_profile
echo $NVM_DIR

Now, you can install node :

nvm install 0.12

From now on, you’re using the v0.12.x of node on this shell, you can install your global dependencies such as grunt-cli (they will be tied up to this version of node).

You may want to install other versions, just do :

nvm install 0.10
nvm install iojs

You’ll have to npm install -g your global dependencies for each version.

Switch of node version with nvm use 0.10 (more infos here).

To have a node activated by default (not to have to nvm use on each new shell), run this (stable being the id of the version):

nvm alias default stable
or
nvm alias default <node --version : v8.10.0>
for changing use...
nvm use <node --version : v8.10.0>
for checking list of installed nodes version...
nvm list
